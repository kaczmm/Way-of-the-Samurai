# Way-of-the-Samurai
A simple command line game, written in Python 3.4.

-"Way of the Samurai" is a command-line game based on rock-paper-scissors
-There are three actions the player or the enemy AI can perform: attack, parry, or wait
  -Attacking will make the enemy AI more defensive, meaning they will be more likely to parry next
  -Parrying will make the enemy AI wary, meaning they will be more likely to wait next
  -Waiting will enrage the enemy AI, making them more likely to attack next
  
-If you and the AI both attack, you will cross swords and no one will be hurt
-Parrying an attack will hurt the attacker
-Parrying a parry does nothing, as does waiting when your opponent is waiting

-Both you and the AI can survive three hits before dieing.
